Overview
This project aims to develop a system capable of recognizing sign language gestures and translating them into text or spoken language. Sign language is a crucial means of communication for people with hearing impairments, and this project seeks to bridge the communication gap by leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques.

Features
*Real-time sign language gesture recognition.
*Translation of recognized gestures into text or spoken language.
*Support for multiple sign languages (e.g., American Sign Language, British Sign Language, etc.).
*User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
Technologies Used
*Python
*OpenCV for computer vision tasks
*TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models
*Flask for creating a web interface (optional)
*HTML/CSS/JavaScript (if developing a web interface)
